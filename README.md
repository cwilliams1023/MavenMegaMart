# Maven Mega Mart

This is a hands-on, project-based course designed to help you master two of the most popular Python packages for data analysis: NumPy and Pandas.



We'll start with a NumPy primer to introduce arrays and array properties, practice common operations like indexing, slicing, filtering and sorting, and explore important concepts like vectorization and broadcasting.



From there we'll dive into Pandas, and focus on the essential tools and methods to explore, analyze, aggregate and transform series and dataframes. You'll practice plotting dataframes with charts and graphs, manipulating time-series data, importing and exporting various file types, and combining dataframes using common join methods.



Throughout the course you'll play the role of Data Analyst for Maven Mega Mart, a large, multinational corporation that operates a chain of retail and grocery stores. Using the Python skills you learn throughout the course, you'll work with members of the Maven Mega Mart team to analyze products, pricing, transactions, and more.
